# FMP PROJECT SO FAR

The FMOD build can be found in `/fmod/build/desktop/`. Right now it's my Game Audio 2 work.
The FMOD project in `/fmod/project/` is a blank project, configured to build to `/fmod/build/desktop/`.

## Documentation/resources that I've been using so far

- [FMOD API documentation](https://www.fmod.com/docs/2.02/api/welcome.html)
- [A specific guide for HTML5](https://www.fmod.com/docs/2.02/api/platforms-html5.html)
- The FMOD Engine for HTML5 download comes with a some very useful examples.
